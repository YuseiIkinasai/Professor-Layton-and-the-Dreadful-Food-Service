# Professor Layton and the Dreadful Food Service
A satirical fangame based on the Professor Layton series of games. The idea started as a powerpoint-type of project inspired by the "Bastard who shat down my chimney" video made by DearestHershel on Youtube.
I began learning Godot for my Game Systems class in College and thought it'd be a fun idea to turn my idea for what was essentially a shitpost into a whole playable fangame. That's where we stand now.
I've completed the demo, which is pretty much a test of all the features I'd like to include in the final game. There's more to be done, but for now: Check out the demo if you'd like! I'd appreciate any
input or critique you can give! Shoot me a message at my twitter (@Yusei_ikinasai) if you have any questions or comments!
